# Welcome to Canvas Pong!

This is my first venture into the HTML5 canvas element. I wanted to try it out, to create simple animations using JavaScript logic. I built this off of [Chris DeLeon of Gamkedo's YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoWqdEACyLI). I then updated the code, and added some features. Planned features I'm currently working on are listed below.

Canvas Pong is a very simple browser pong game, played using your mouse cursor. The ball speeds up the longer each round goes, until someone (you or the currently AI player 2) scores a point!

## How to try it out:

Simply download the .html file and open it in your web browser!

## Planned features:

- Game levels, with decreasing paddle lengths and increasing ball speeds
- More background screen displays, including level indicators
- Overall visual polishing
